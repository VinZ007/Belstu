            <article id="article1">

                <p>The 2023 Formula 1 season was defined by Max Verstappen's unprecedented dominance, who won 19 out of
                    22 races and secured his third consecutive World Drivers' Championship title for Red Bull Racing,
                    which also won the Constructors' Championship.</p>
                <p>Notable elements included the addition of the Las Vegas Grand Prix, a new event on the calendar, and
                    significant strides in Formula 1's sustainability efforts, such as the introduction of the first
                    Impact Report and the use of biofuel-powered trucks for European logistics. </p>

        <h2>Season 2024</h2>
        <article>

            <p id="bord">The 2024 Formula 1 season was a year of unexpected drama, featuring a record seven different
                winners, a
                thrilling constructor's championship battle that went down to the final race, and impressive
                performances from Lando Norris and McLaren, who emerged as the biggest challengers to Max Verstappen's
                dominance.</p>
            <p>Verstappen ultimately secured his fourth consecutive Drivers' Championship, though less decisively than
                in previous years, while sustainability efforts focused on reducing the sport's carbon footprint through
                increased use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and optimizing the race calendar. </p>
